# There are following types of Binary Trees

    - Full Binary Tree  : Every node having either 2 or 0 child

  Complete Binary Tree : -> All levels are full expect the last one and in last level first nodes will get from left side.

  Perfect Binary Tree : All levels are full.

  Balanced Binary Tree : hieght should be of O(logn)  

  Degenerate Binary Tree : Skewed Trees

# Representation of Binary Tree

- 
struct Node{
    int data;
    struct Node* left;
    sruct Node* right;
    Node(int val){
        data= val;
        left=right=nullptr;
    }
};

// creattree

int main(){
    struct Node* root=new Node(1);
    root->left= new Node(2);
    root->left= new Node(3);

}
